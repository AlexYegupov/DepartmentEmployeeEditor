# Test task

Need to create a small application on React.
For backend use any mock-server like  https://github.com/typicode/json-server

## Models
Department (name: string)
Employee (firstName: string, lastName: string, departmentId:number) 

## Interface
Left Menu: Departments, Employees
 
Content: table for editing selected entity.


# Solution: quick start

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## TODO
 - checking patching result (pessimistic)
